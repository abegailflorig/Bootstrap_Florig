      <p><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
      I'm Abegail D. Florig, but you can call me Beng for short. I'm 18 years old and I was born on October 21, 2005. At the moment, I live in Tubod, Iligan City. There are five members in my family. My father's name is Sulpicio M. Florig. He passed away six years ago due to tumor cancer. My mother's name is Sisinia D. Florig; she is a lovely housewife. I have two siblings, one brother and one sister. My brother's name is Jerome D. Florig; he is twenty-one years old. My sister's name is Jamie D. Florig; she is nineteen years old.</p>
      
      <p><strong>MY HOBBIES</strong><br>
      My hobbies on online platforms include playing Mobile Legends and Call of Duty, watching Netflix, YouTube, and TikTok. I also use Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter to post my rants, pictures, and stories about my day. In sports, I play badminton, but I also want to learn sports like volleyball and basketball. I aim to learn their rules and techniques to avoid accidents.</p>
      
      <p><strong>THINGS I LIKE, FAVORITES, and EXPERIENCES</strong><br>
      My favorite foods, desserts, and drinks include fried chicken, spaghetti, caldereta, nilagang baboy, mango float, cake, iced coffee, milk tea, and soft drinks. I love cooking and doing household chores. I had an OJT at Tita Fannies in Palao. It was very memorable for me because I learned about workplace conduct and what to do and what not to do. Unfortunately, I couldn't pursue my desired course, which is HM, due to financial constraints.</p>
